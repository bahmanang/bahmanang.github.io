I am a Research Associate (Post-Doc) in the [Department of Applied Mathematics](https://amath.washington.edu/) at the Univeristy of Washington and also a faculty member of the Computational Finance and Risk Management ([CFRM program](https://depts.washington.edu/compfin/)). Before joining UW, I served as a Post-Doc in the [Department of Mathematics](https://lsa.umich.edu/math) at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor for three years and also spent 8 months as a visiting Post-Doc in [Department of System Engineering and Engineering Management](http://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/) at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong. I hold a D.Phil. in Mathematics from [University of Oxford](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/), UK, a M.Sc. in Applied Mathematics from [University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/en/am/), the Netherlands, and a B.Sc. in Industrial Engineering from [Sharif University of Technology](http://ie.sharif.ir/ie/en/index.php), Iran.

My research interest is in applications of Stochastic Control Theory in Finance and Insurance. I am also passionate about teaching Financial Data Science and Machine Learning.
