I am a Research Associate (Post-Doc) in the [Department of Applied Mathematics at the Univeristy of Washington](https://amath.washington.edu/) and also a faculty member of [the Computational Finance and Risk Management (CFRM) program](https://depts.washington.edu/compfin/). Before joining UW, I served as a Post-Doc in the [Department of Mathematics at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](https://lsa.umich.edu/math) for three years and also spent 8 months as a visiting Post-Doc in [Department of System Engineering and Engineering Management at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong](http://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/). I hold a D.Phil. in Mathematics from [University of Oxford, UK](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/).

My research interest is in applications of Stochastic Control Theory in Finance and Insurance. I am also passionate about teaching Financial Data Science and Machine Learning.
