I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Mathematics](http://www.math.miami.edu/) at the [University of Miami](http://www.miami.edu/). My research interest lies primarily in studying stochastic control problems arising in finance and insurance. Recent projects include [optimal trading of futures contracts](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.04943), [optimal dividend policies under a drawdown constraint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07499), and [developing the discrete-time version of the forward performance measure](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04494). You can find more details about my research [here](https://bahmanang.github.io/publications/).


I hold a DPhil in Mathematics from the [University of Oxford](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/) which I have completed in 2014 under the supervision of [Thaleia Zariphopoulou](https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/zariphop/). Here are [my page on the Mathematics Genealogy Project](https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=184786) and a detailed [CV](https://bahmanang.github.io/files/Angoshtari-CV.pdf).
