I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Mathematics](http://www.math.miami.edu/) at the [University of Miami](http://www.miami.edu/). My research interest lies primarily in studying stochastic control problems arising in finance and insurance. Recently, I have been working on developing the so-called Predictable Forward Perforemance Processes (see [here](http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04494), [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03608), and [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16228)) and on optimal consumption models under a habit-formation constraint (see [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02277) and [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03414)). For more details about my research, see my [publications page](https://bahmanang.github.io/publications/).


I hold a DPhil in Mathematics from the [University of Oxford](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/) which I have completed in 2014 under the supervision of [Thaleia Zariphopoulou](https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/zariphop/). Here are links to [my page on the Mathematics Genealogy Project](https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=184786) and [my CV](https://bahmanang.github.io/files/Angoshtari-CV.pdf).
